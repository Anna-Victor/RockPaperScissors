            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo)[1][2][3] is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">wikipedia</a> </p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors.</p><p>The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.</p><p>Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.</p><p>If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.</p><p>The hand signals are given simultaneously by both players.The ritual used to get players in sync with each other so they can deliver their throws simultaneously is called the prime.</p><p>To ensure a fair match the players must be in sync with their primes.</p><p>Players must determine before play how many times they pump their arms during the prime phase, usually two or three times before the final delivery of their throw.<a href = "https://www.pgpedia.com/r/rock-paper-scissors#:~:text=The%20rock%20is%20a%20closed,and%20scissors%20wins%20against%20paper.">pgpedia</a>
